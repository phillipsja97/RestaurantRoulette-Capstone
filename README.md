# RestaurantRoulette-Capstone
Back-End Capstone Project

* Restaurant Roulette will be a full stack application using React.js, Material-UI, Bit.dev, Firebase for Authentication, and Axios for the Front-End, and C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Dapper, and SQL Server for the Back-End API. The premise of the application will be to allow a user to create a session between one or more friends, pick which categories of restaurants they would go to and in what city/location, and then swipe yes or no with a Tinder-like user interface on a list of restaurants, generated from a Yelp API. Once each user has swiped, all of the restaurants that the users said yes to will be compared and the matches will be stored, and then a random winner out of the matches is chosen. 

## Screenshots and demo-link coming soon!
